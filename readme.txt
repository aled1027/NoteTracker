Current work:
	- Bug on close
I want to add
	- Add private string name and private string path to Note
		- then update addtoDB()
	- Add search feature for adding new files. Or an easier way of doing it. 
	- Add folders so it doesn't look like a bunch of random files
		- ^^ will require fixing makefile
	- Folders? Some semblance of organization? Color coding?
		keywords or tags (samething as Taggit for reddit)
		could get some of this data from ls -ltr 
	Easier way to add. Like they go through the folders and find it somehow. 
		I had an idea but forgot it. Need to make it easier than type path.
	GUI
	User password and settings (require something similar to a coookie)
	
Other things to consider adding
	Encryption
	Statistics
	put it online
	link it with an app... much harder
		android app... not even written in Objective-C...
