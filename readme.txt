I want to add
	Folders? Some semblance of organization? Color coding?
		keywords or tags (samething as Taggit for reddit)
		could get some of this data from ls -ltr 
	GUI
	User password and settings (require something similar to a coookie)
	
Other things to consider adding
	Encryption
	Statistics
	put it online
	link it with an app... much harder
		android app... not even written in Objective-C...
change.
