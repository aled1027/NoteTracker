Stop working on anything related to the command line interface. Just add features. 

Current work:
	- check for duplicates in database
I want to add
	- Folders? Some semblance of organization? Color coding?
		keywords or tags (samething as Taggit for reddit)
		could get some of this data from ls -ltr 
	- Easier way to add new files. Like they go through the folders and find it somehow. 
		I had an idea but forgot it. Need to make it easier than type path.
	- fix interface
	
Other things to consider adding
	User password and settings (require something similar to a coookie)
	GUI
	Encryption
	Statistics
	put it online
	link it with an app... much harder
		android app... not even written in Objective-C...
